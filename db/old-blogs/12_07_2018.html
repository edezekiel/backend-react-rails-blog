<p>❤️ Pair Programming</p>

<p>December 7, 2018</p>

<p>Time continues to fly at Flatiron bookcamp. We are
wrapping up mod two today (Ruby on Rails) and presenting
projects.</p>

<p><strong>Teamwork</strong></p>

<p>We worked on ruby on rails projects in teams. My partner was Kaeland
and I am so glad that we got paired together!</p>

<p>We finally got to flex our Ruby on Rails knowledge. More importantly,
we had blast working together. Here's the link our app: <a href="https://infinite-anchorage-40950.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">DailyGifs</a>.

<p>There were several points during project week where things could have
gone sideways. There were some early issues with our domain model,
difficult password authentication concepts, and a fair number of styling
bugs.</p>

<p>However, Kaeland's upbeat attitude and our teamwork helped us stay in
"coding flow" and keep the ball rolling. I am so proud of our final
product.</p>

<p>If you are just starting out with learning to code, look for
  opportunities to work on a team. It's been one of the highlights
  of the bootcamp so far.</p>

<p><strong>Our Web App - DailyGif</strong></p>

<p>If you've made it this far in this blog post, you may be wondering
what we actually built! Here's a quick rundown:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The web app is called DailyGif.</li>
  <li>We wanted to make something that was a cross between
    <a href="https://iwastesomuchtime.com/">iwastesomuchtime.com</a>
    and <a href="https://giphy.com/">GIPHY</a>. In other words, a fun
    website for people who love gifs!
  </li>
  <li>DailyGif users can signup, login, view a feed of recently created gifs,
  and upload gifs.</li>
  <li>We picked Semantic UI for our CSS framework. Even with a framework,
   it took about a day and a half to work out all the styling kinks.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Thank You Flatiron!</strong></p>

<p>Before I wrap up this post, I want to thank all of the instructors
 and staff at Flatiron in Atlanta. I really appreciate the awesome culture,
 technical support, and guidance. Thank you!</p>
