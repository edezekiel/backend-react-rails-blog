<p>Implementing CSS Grid</p>

<p>October 25, 2018</p>

<p>T-minus five days until I start the Flatiron bootcamp. I took a break
from some Git exercise to bring you all this update!</p>

<p>I have made a lot of changes to this site under the hood. Mainly, I
converted the content section to the CSS "grid" display style.
I also switched the navbar back to using Flexbox.</p>

<p>If you're on a laptop or desktop, expand the browser to full screen
and you'll notice that blog posts now line up in rows and columns. On a
mobile device, the posts will collapse into a single column. This is all
thanks to CSS Grid!</p>

<p>Now that the main content is laid out in a grid system, it will be
much easier to make the website more "responsive." I'll cover responsive
web design in more detail soon.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading and have a great week. </p>
