<p>CSS Styling Using Flexbox</p>

<p>October 12, 2018</p>

<p>This week I added some style to my blog using CSS and Flexbox. This post summarizes these concepts and describes how I applied them to my site.</p>
<p>CSS stands for Cascading-Style-Sheets. CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users -- how they are styled, laid out, etc.</p>
<p>The Flexible Box Module (Flexbox) is a new layout mode that was introduced CSS3. See this article by spaceninja, <a href="https://spaceninja.com/2015/08/24/what-is-flexbox/"><span>"What is Flexbox, An elegant layout method for a more civilized age",</span></a> for a great background on the origin and purpose of Flexbox.</p>
<p>When a browser displays a document, it actually displays a combination of the document's content with its style information. Web browsers convert the document's content (the HTML) and style information (CSS) into the Document Object Model (DOM). When you view a webpage you are actually viewing a display of the contents of the DOM.</p>
<p>I created the CSS style sheet and linked it to my HMTL file. Then I used a great guide from <a href='https://markheath.net/post/simple-css-blog-layout-flexbox'><span>markheath.net</span></a> to incorporate Flexbox concepts into the CSS and HTML files.</p>
