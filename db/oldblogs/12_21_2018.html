<p>fetch() - A Line-By-Line Walkthrough</p>

<p>December 21, 2018</p>

<p>Learning the <code>fetch</code> API can be a struggle. It certainly
  was for me. Even when I got it working I had trouble explaining why
  it worked.</p>

<p>This article walks through each line of a simple fetch example in an
  attempt to demystify the process. I pulled example code from a
  <a href="https://scotch.io/tutorials/how-to-use-the-javascript-fetch-api-to-get-data">tutorial</a>
  on scotch.io. I loved this tutorial, and I definitely recommend working through it!
</p>

<p> <strong>Let's get started.</strong></p>

<p>Here is an example of a simple fetch request:</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/edezekiel/da0b953efa76baaadfcfb05b83fee2a0.js"></script></p>

<p>As discussed in the scotch.io tutorial, this example fetches data
  about "authors" from an API, and calls a function that adds those
  authors to the page.</p>

<p><strong><code>Line 1: fetch(url)</code></strong></p>

<p>The first line initiates a GET request (by default) to a url.
This generates <strong>promise one</strong>, and returns that promise.</p>

<p><strong><code>Line 2: .then((resp) => resp.json())</code></strong></p>

<p>The second line is a callback. It runs after promise one is complete.
This line should get the value from the fetch (a response). By default, the
response is text.</p>

<p>We want to convert the text to json, so we accept the response as
  an argument to another function and call .json() method to parse it.</p>

<p>Parsing the text in our example to json happens almost instantaneously.
However, this process could take several seconds if there is a lot of data to parse.</p>

<p>Just like we don't want to hold up the browser waiting on a server to
return a response, we don't want to hold up the browser waiting on
parsing text into json.</p>

<p>Therefore, this line returns <strong>promise two</strong>.</p>

<p><strong><code>Line 3: .then(function(data) {//someFunction})})</code></strong></p>

<p>By line three the json parsing is complete. We finally have a real
 JavaScript object with data that we can work with. Now we can pass that
 data into another function and process it in some way. </p>

<p> <strong>Final Thoughts</strong> </p>

<p>Remember that any function that returns a promise, has to throw something on the callback
queue to process the result when it's ready.</p>
