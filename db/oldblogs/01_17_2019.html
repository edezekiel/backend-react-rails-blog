<p>Using Javascript's <code>this</code> Keyword in React</p>

<p>January 17, 2019</p>

<p>In this post, I break down the keyword <code>this</code> and
provide a quick example using React.</p>

<strong><p>Why Should I Care About <code>this</code> in React?</p></strong>

<p>My Flatiron cohort is finally getting to use React js! React has a ton
of features that simplify writing front-end Javascript code.</p>

<p>However, it's even more important to understand how the keyword
<code>this</code> works. Whether you're defining a method, setting
state, lifting state up, referring to props, etc., the value of
<code>this</code> can make or break your app.</p>

<strong><p><code>this</code> Scope in the Browser (Global)</p></strong>

<p>If you type <code>this</code> in chrome's dev console, the console returns:</p>

<p><code>Window {postMessage: ƒ, blur: ƒ, focus: ƒ, close: ƒ,
  parent: Window, …}</code>.</p>

  the <code>window</code> object.</p>

<strong><p><code>this</code> Scope Inside a New Object</p></strong>

<p>Let's create a simple object and set some properties:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/edezekiel/54a8ff64664388da060e5b1c213adc61.js"></script>

<p>Next, we can define a method called "mySum" on myObject. When mySum
calls on <code>this</code>, <code>this</code> refers to myObject:</p>

<strong><p>Arrow Functions: Explicitly Setting <code>this</code></p></strong>

<p>As noted in Trey's article, there are several ways to explicitly set
<code>this</code> on a function. One way is to use the arrow
function introduced in ES6.</p>

<p><a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/06/es6-in-depth-arrow-functions/">Here</a>
is a great article by Jason Orendorff comparing the difference in behavior between
 <code>this</code> in ordinary functions and arrow functions. </p>

 <p>Jason explains it best:
  <blockquote
  cite="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/06/es6-in-depth-arrow-functions/">
  <p>Arrow functions do not have their own <code>this</code> value. The value of
    <code>this</code> inside an arrow function is always inherited from the enclosing
    scope.</p>
  </blockquote>

<strong><p>Refactoring a React js Example Using Arrow Functions</p></strong>

<p>Facebook provides great <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html">documentation</a>
  on React JS. One of the "Main Concepts" in the getting started guide
  explaines how to "lift state up."</p>

<p>If you are not familiar with this concept, you should
work through their <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html">Lifting State Up</a>
guide before continuing with this article.</p>

<p>Interestingly, in FB's example they use <code>bind</code> instead
  of arrow functions to set the value of <code>this</code>:</p>

<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/edezekiel/b5e4e344a39cd6182aec19d673e22a93.js"></script></p>

<p>FB's example can easily be refactored using the arrow function
  instead of bind:</p>

<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/edezekiel/ece503d98749642af4c60c5d9197f7e1.js"></script></p>

<p><a href="https://codepen.io/edezekiel/pen/GPaOMr">Here</a> is the codepen
  to my version using the arrow function.</p>

<strong><p>Weird Highlighting Error with Refactored CodePen Example</p></strong>

<p>If you open my codepen you may notice a weird highlighting issue.
The handleCelciusChange and handleFarenheitChange syntax highlighting
is off. Codepen's syntax highlighter thinks the code is broken, but the
JS(Babel) tool is still able to render the Calculator component.</p>
